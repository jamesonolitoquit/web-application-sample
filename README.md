# Expense Tracker - Sample Website

**Designed by Jameson A. Olitoquit**

This is a sample Expense Tracker web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), demonstrating problem-solving, state management, and client-side logic. It uses React hooks for state management and localStorage for persistence, running entirely in the browser without any server dependencies.

## Features

- Add expenses with amount, description, date, and optional category
- View list of all expenses
- Delete expenses
- Summary of total expenses
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Fully offline-capable

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React useState and useEffect
- **Persistence:** Browser localStorage

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
